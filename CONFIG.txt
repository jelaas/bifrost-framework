About the Configuration, Directories and Files

When the Bifrost distribution is started for the first time, the
script /sbin/configure is used to setup the machine in a simple way.
For more advanced usage, one will have to edit separate configuration
files and check that everything is correctly done...

Normally the flash disk is mounted read-only and to be able to edit
any configuration it must be remounted. You can for this purpose use
'remount w' and 'remount r' respectively.

Some programs and scripts to aid in the setup process:

/sbin/configure   For a fast setup of interfaces, IP-numbers, passwords
		  and such. It stores some of the default values in
		  /etc/.config and /etc/.config.old so they may be used
		  again at a later time.

/sbin/chkconfig   With no arguments given, it will display the current
		  setup - daemons started at boot time, routing options,
		  active interfaces and some other stuff as well.
		  Given parameters, it can be used to turn on and off
		  these options.

/etc/rc.d/rc.interfaces	Is used to bring up or down interfaces. It can
			also show the current setup of the interface,
			with the 'show' option.


Directories and Files:

/etc		  Stores a lot of config files (for most of the daemons)
		  and includes a number of important sub directories.

/etc/config.flags Contain variables used by /sbin/chkconfig and the rc
		  startup scripts. These files/variables say either yes
		  or no. Chkconfig can be used to control these flags.
		  Read the /etc/config.flags/.README file for further info.

/etc/config.data  Contain files with environment variables used by
		  the rc startup scripts, such as IP-numbers, default
		  routes and different network options. These files
		  can be edited by hand using 'vi' or 'edit'.
		  Read the /etc/config.data/.README file for further info.

/etc/rc.d	  All the rc scripts are located here. They are mostly
		  data driven by the config and options files, but can
		  be edited by hand if needed. Read the /etc/rc.d/README
		  file for further info.

/filter		  Firewall (and router) filters should be stored here.
		  Examples can be found in the /fw-examples directory.

/contrib	  Contributed scripts and programs.

/opt		  Optional Bifrost packages, like Emacs, sniffers and
		  network loggers, snmp, Zebra, Nomad and such should
		  be installed here (binaries, configuration files and
		  dedicated libraries if possible).
