3G connectivity in bifrost
--------------------------
Written by Hannes Antero Junnila.

1. Introduction

This documents describes what prerequisites are needed and how to run a 3G internet connection. This tutorial is based on a Huawei E1550 modem using a Comviq sim-card.

2. Requirements

Recent linux kernel built with at least the following options/modules:

option (CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_OPTION)
usbserial (CONFIG_USB_SERIAL)
ppp_generic (CONFIG_PPP)

The following software:

pppd (available from bifrost package repository)

usb_modeswitch

3. Setup

Run the following commands

mkdir /var/lock   <- This sould be added to init-scripts

modprobe ppp_generic  <-  This sould be added to device-detect

usb_modeswitch -v 0x12d1 -p 0x1446 -V 0x12d1 -P 0x1001 -M "55534243000000000000000000000011060000000000000000000000000000"

(If necessary change the values to correspond to the usb manufacturer, product (-v and -p are the ones lsusb show, -V and -P are the ones option expects). -M is the magic command for the Huawei modems to change from CDROM-mode to Serial-mode) 

pppd call tele2

TIP: If everything doesnt work out, you can add the following in /etc/syslog.conf and run kill -HUP `cat /var/run/syslogd.pid`. After that you can see the communication on the serial line in /var/log/ppp

ppp.* -/var/log/ppp
