 Install Bifrost from diskimage
--------------------------------
Insert usb-memory.
If your operatingsystem automatically mounts the media you need to unmount it first.
Usually this will be: "umount /dev/sdb1"
You can check which device or path you need to unmount by issuing the "mount" command.

Now copy the diskimage to your device.
$ dd if=bifrost.img of=/dev/sdx bs=4096

You need to change "/dev/sdx" to the actual device.
ATTN! If you write to the wrong device you risk DESTROYING DATA on another harddrive/media.

If the usb-memory refuses to boot (possibly with a GRUB error),
 see "Rescue a failed grub2 installation" below.

 Install Bifrost by hand
-------------------------
Insert usb-memory.
If your operatingsystem automatically mounts the media you need to unmount it first.
Usually this will be: "umount /dev/sdb1"
You can check which device or path you need to unmount by issuing the "mount" command.

Use fdisk to remove any existing partitions and create a partition for bifrost.
Create an ext2 filesystem on this partition.
$ mke2fs /dev/sdx1

Label the filesystem as "bifrost". This is important for boot to work correctly.
$ e2label /dev/sdx1 bifrost

Unpack the Bifrost distribution tarball into the filesystem.
$ mount /dev/sdx1 /mnt
$ cd /mnt
$ tar xf bifrost-7.1-1.tar.gz

Chroot into the filesystem.
$ chroot /mnt

Install grub. 
$ mount -t devtmpfs devtmpfs /dev
$ mount -t proc proc /proc
$ grub-install /dev/sdx
$ grub-mkconfig > /boot/grub/grub.cfg
$ umount /dev
$ umount /proc
$ sync

 Creating a bootable diskimage from within Bifrost 7.1
-------------------------------------------------------
First you need the bifrost distribution tarball.
Download or copy to /.
$ make-bifrost-image /bifrost-beta-7.1-1.tar.gz
The image is now at /tmp/imagefs/bifrost.img
To install just copy or dd to a device.
$ dd if=/tmp/imagefs/bifrost.img of=/dev/sdx bs=4096

 Grub2 installation
--------------------
Boot Bifrost as usual.

$ remount w
$ grub-install /dev/sda
$ grub-mkconfig > /boot/grub/grub.cfg

 Rescue a failed grub2 installation
-------------------------------------
Change /dev/sdx below to the actual device.
Usually it will be /dev/sdb.

$ mount /dev/sdx1 /mnt
$ chroot /mnt
$ mount -t devtmpfs devtmpfs /dev
$ mount -t proc proc /proc
$ grub-install /dev/sdx
$ grub-mkconfig > /boot/grub/grub.cfg
$ sync
 
 Expanding the root filesystem
-------------------------------
Note start of partition
$ partx 1 /dev/sda -o start

Resize partition
$ fdisk /dev/sda
d
n
p
1
<startsector>
<return>
w

$ reboot

 Creating additional partitions
--------------------------------
If you need to have a writable partition to continuously save data, /var is used for this.
By default /var is tmpfs filesystem which wont survive reboots.
Instead of expanding the root partition you can use this space to create a separate /var partition.
The advantage is that you can keep the root filesystem mounted read-only, which is the safest option. If the root filesystem is mounted read-write the possibility of filesystem corruption exist.

If you will make extensive use of optional packages consider creating a separate partition for /opt.
