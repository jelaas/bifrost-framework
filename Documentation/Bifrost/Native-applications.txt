allcaps
-------
Reports if current process has all capabilities.
This is an easy way to figure out if we are inside a container or not.
Inside a virtualization container capabilities are limited, atleast the capability to reboot
 or shutdown the system is absent.

bifrost-upgrade
---------------
Can be run after an upgrade of Bifrost. To upgrade you just untar the newer Bifrost distribution
tarball over root '/'.
bifrost-upgrade will make sure there are no duplicates of the binaries installed.

cpuinfo
-------
Information about the system CPUs.
Script-friendly.

cpuinfo [-aw] [-ps] [-n CPU] [key]
version 1.1
 -a --all         Output all keys found.
 -n --cpu         Output info for this cpu only.
 -w --nowhite     Do not output whitespace in values.
 -p --prefix S    Prefix values with string S.
 -s --suffix S    Append string S to values.
 --debug

key = freq|node ...


cpu_pkts
--------
Displays number of network packets handled per CPU.
First run established the baseline and gives no output.
Following executions of the program will give the difference since the last run.

dev-populate
------------
Not currently used.
The blockdev-populate executable will populate the /dev directory with devicenodes
for block-devices. This is currently handled by the devtmpfs which is mounted at boot by the kernel.
If devtmpfs is missing the init script will start blockdev-populate.

devtag
------
With devtag you select and use specific devices without concerning youself with which devicename/node 
it currently has.
Main use is for USB-devices that will receive a device-name according to the order of discovery by
 the kernel.
A number of Bifrost programs are patched to make direct use of devtag:
 - minicom
 - tty_talk
 - stty

devtag [-hl] [--ns TAG CMD..] [-c TAG SEL..] [TAG]
 version 1.0.5
 -l --list
      list devnames and lookup info
 --ns TAG CMD ARG*
      Runs 'CMD' or bash in a separate mount name space.
      This name space has its own mount of /dev with a devicenode created
      according to configuration of the devtag 'TAG'.
 -c --create TAG SELECTOR+
      'TAG' is your handle for the device that matches the given selectors.
      'SELECTOR' is a 'name=value' pair. Suitable selectors is reported by the
      '--list' option.
 Without an argument:
      Scans for and prints device information suitable as arguments for the
      'devname' program.
 Without exactly one argument [TAG]:
      Lookup device node for devtag 'TAG'. Print result on stdout.
 If invoked as 'devtagns' the program will behave as the '--ns' option was given.

 Magic selectors (maybe not reported by devname-info):
  dev=<pattern>               device name pattern for selecting device node
  devname=<nodename>          devname-set will use this constant name for the device node
  class=<subsystem>           class is usb by default

eth-affinity
------------
Is run by Bifrost when configuring an interface.
eth-affinity will assign irq-vectors so that all CPUs are used for traffic in an optimal way.
Bifrost tries to make sure that CPU 0 is always free of forwarding traffic.
CPU 0 is also used exclusively for userspace: routing daemons, sshd etc.

ifinfo
------
Information about network interfaces.
Script-friendly.

ifinfo [-aw] [-ps] [-i IFNAME|-I ifindex] [key]
version 1.6
 -a --all         Output all keys found.
 -w --nowhite     Do not output whitespace in values.
 -p --prefix S    Prefix values with string S.
 -s --suffix S    Append string S to values.
 --debug

key = ifname|ifindex|mac|ipv4 ...

ifstat2
-------
Network interface rx/tx statistics.

Usage: ifstat2 [ -h?vVzrnasd:t: ] [ PATTERN [ PATTERN ] ]
 client options:
  -e extended statistics
  -v print version
  -i verbose info
  -h this help
 daemon options;
  -d SECS -- scan interval in SECS seconds and daemonize
  -t SECS -- time constant for average calc [60] (t>d)

iocethtool
----------
Generic interface to ethtool ioctls.

iocethtool [-vh] ETHDEV CMD [FORMAT]*
 Version 0.2 110404
 -h --help
 --list     List known ethtool ioctl names.
 -v --verbose
 CMD = number or name of ethtool ioctl.
       Ex. 0x13, ETHTOOL_GPAUSEPARAM
 FORMAT = [s|b|d]N:[V]
 N = number of bytes
 V = value
 s = string, b = bitfield, d = decimal

Examples:
 Reading ETHTOOL_GPAUSEPARAM
 $ iocethtool eth0 0x12 4: 4: 4:
 Setting ETHTOOL_SPAUSEPARAM
 $ iocethtool eth0 ETHTOOL_SPAUSEPARAM 4:1 4:1 4:1
 Reading ETHTOOL_GDRVINFO
 $ iocethtool eth0 0x3 s32: s32:

loop
----
Make a busyloop.
Soaks up userspace CPU.

make_bifrost
------------
Puts the Bifrost distribution on media.

Usage: /sbin/make_bifrost [-u] <target device> <partition size> <fs image> [archives]

    -u              -- u = does not request confirmation
    target device   -- device to write the archive to, this varies a
                       lot from host to host, but is usualy NOT hda/sda
    partition size  -- size of the 1st partition in MiBs. Size *must* be
                       smaller than the total size of the media. Rest of the
                       space is used for swap partition. If the partition size
                       is set to 0, all of the available space is used for
                       partition 1 and swap partition is not created
    fs image        -- a gziped image of a bootable ext2 file system
                       (eg. boot_image.gz, which is included in this package)
    archives        -- packages (tarballs). This list should also include the
                       actual Bifrost package (eg. bifrost-6.1-beta3.tar.gz)

  note that <device> should not containg the leading "/dev/"

nsutil
------
Namespace utilities.

 ns
 --
 Create a new namespace.
 ns [-dv] [-t --type NS] [-n --name NAME][-c|--dropcaps CAPSET][-N|--nsrun CMD] [-H|--hrun CMD] [--log LOG] [-- [pipe:]CMD [ARGS ..]]

 -d --daemonize
 -t --type net|vfs|pid|uts|ipc|user|all
 --dropcaps [fkmincubst]
 -N --nsrun [pipe:]CMD
 -H --hrun CMD
 -p --pipe NAME - Create a pipe between host and guest. Accessed via fds ENV['H2G_<name>'] = fd,fd
 --log LOGFILE

 After the child is created, parent will execute all --hrun commands.
 Meanwhile the child waits until parent signals that it is done. This
  is done via a pipe.
 After receiving the signal the child runs all --nsrun commands.

 Examples:
 Create a new net namespace and assign eth0:
  ns -t net --hrun "/sbin/nsnetif -i eth0"

 nsnetif
 -------

 veth
 ----
 veth -c --create IF1 IF2
  Create a pair of veth interfaces.

 macvlan
 -------
 macvlan -c --create MASTER NAME (private|vepa|bridge)
  Create a macvlan interface.

remount
-------
Remount root filesystem read-write or read-only.
Specify 'r' or 'w' as remount operation.

Remount can also control the synchronous mount-flag.
By default the root filesystem is mounted with the synchronous flag in Bifrost version 7.1 and later.
Specify 'a' to remount the root filesystem without the synchronous flag.
Specify 's' to remount synchronous.

rtstat
------
Routing statistics.

rtstat        Version 0.44 080327
              -help
              -i interval
              -c count
              -s subject [0-2]

schedlat
--------
Measure scheduling latencies.

schedlat [-hvim] [CPU#]
 Version 1.2 By Jens Laas, UU 2009-2011.
 -v --verbose
 -i --interval SECONDS [2]
 -m --minmax (do not compute average and median)
 -a --average (compute average and median)
 -p --pause NS -- nanosleep NS between intervals

Output:
<cpu>:<secs>:<max>:<min>:<avg>:<median>:<samples>:<overflows>:
avg == -1 in case of overflow during calculation.
overflows > 0 if number of samples does not fit in calibrated array.
Values in usec.

tty_talk
--------
tty_talk sends command to terminal and waits for response

tty_talk [-BAUDRATE] terminal command
 Valid baudrates 4800, 9600 (Default), 19200, 38400 bps

vers
----
Sort names according to version.

vers [-l] [-n] argument ..
Sorts arguments by version.
By default the argument is assumed to be a filename and the path is stripped from the name.
 -l       only print highest versions
 -n       only print names
 -p       keep path part of argument
