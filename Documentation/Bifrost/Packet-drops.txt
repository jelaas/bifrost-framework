Have you checked that there is an ip route for the packet?
Once the packet is received the receiving interface is no longer important (except for
rp checks).

Try disabling rp_filter if its enabled.
$ echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/default/rp_filter
$ echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/<dev>/rp_filter

Interface configuration should be:
CONFIG_NO_SPOOF=no in /etc/config.data/<dev>.nic
You can also disable "no_spoof" for the interface via the 'configure' program.

Also you should check _where_ the packet is dropped if possible.
$ netstat -s
$ netstat -i <dev>
$ tc -s qdisc show dev <dev>
$ iptables -xnvL

Worried about ARP ?
You can check with tcpdump if arp answers are getting through. If you have a ping
running against nexthop, does the problem disappear ?
The timeout is based on /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/default/base_reachable_time_ms
