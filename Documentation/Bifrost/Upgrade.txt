 Upgrading existing installation
---------------------------------

Simply unpack the distrubution tarball from the root '/' directory.
Run: 'bifrost-upgrade'.
Then reboot.

If your previous Bifrost version was below 7.1 you may wish to install the grub2 boot loader.
See Install.txt for instructions.
