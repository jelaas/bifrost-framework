egetty
------

egetty makes the "console" available over an ethernet device.
This is not a real console, but a session more like telnet/ssh.
egetty will start the login program and send any output on the specified ethernet device.

To listen to this output and to send input you need to use the econsole program as a client.

The data is sent in pure ethernet frames using a very simple packet structure. IP is not involved.
Communcation can only happen over the connected link.

You can start egetty by putting an entry in /etc/inittab, just like your normal getty.

Like:
e1:2345:respawn:/usr/bin/taskset -c 0 /sbin/egetty eth0

To scan for consoles you use econsole like:
# econsole eth0 scan
Scanning for econsoles
Console: 0 00:0d:b9:24:7b:58

To connect you can use:

# econsole eth0 00:0d:b9:24:7b:58 0
Use CTRL-] to close connection.
