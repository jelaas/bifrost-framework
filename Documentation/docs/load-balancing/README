Load balancing have been tested on a Bifrost firewall with
static routing. One external ATM interface and four internal
Ethernet interfaces working in parallel. Note that it may be
impossible to use this feature on a router with full
Internet routing table (or even multiple tables), due to
memory consumption. That has not been tested at all...

For a simple network with point to point connections however,
it works just fine. Take care when designing firewall filters.
Example networking config can be found in /etc/rc.d/rc.inet.routes
and in the load-balancing.txt "HOWTO" file.
