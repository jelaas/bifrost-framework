Example filter rules for ipchains.

NOTE! In Bifrost 4.0 and later, you should really use the new
netfilter/iptables instead. No example files included though, sorry...
(except for Nomad and L7-filter)

example1 = Rules to protect a single machine behind a Bifrost
example2 = Rules to protect a complete network
example3 = Rules to protect and restrict a private student lab network
example4 = Rules to protect a router
layer7   = A setup for layer7 detection (file sharing protocols and others)
nomad    = Rules for the Bifrost Nomad project

Just copy the fwrules* files to the /filter directory and the fwrules main
file will be called from rc.inet at boot time.

When using iptables with a 2.5 or 2.6 kernel, make sure to include the
module path. For exmple in fwrules you should add:

. /etc/config.data/kernel

and then for example:

insmod /lib/modules/$KERNEL/kernel/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.ko 2> /dev/null
insmod /lib/modules/$KERNEL/kernel/net/ipv4/netfilter/iptable_filter.ko 2> /dev/null

An alternative is to use modprobe, as of Bifrost v5.14 and later:

modprobe ip_tables
modprobe iptable_filter
