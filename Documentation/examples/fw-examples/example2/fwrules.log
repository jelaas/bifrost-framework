# Explicit logging. The DENY jump is not necessary,
# but will appear as DENY in the log which is better
# than just a plain logged entry.
# We don't allow the traffic to get through and therefor
# it is more efficient to DENY it here than to let it parse
# the rest of the rules.
# As an example, the fwrules.login contains log rules without
# DENY or ACCEPT just to get a log on each new connection.
