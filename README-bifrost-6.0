Bifrost 6.0  (Bifrost Software Distribution)

Some of the news.

ftp://robur.slu.se:/pub/Linux/bifrost/v6/bifrost-6.0rc6.tgz

LABEL=bifrost is used for mounting and fsck of rootfs.

VLAN scripts are added. Contribution by Pehr Söderman <Pehrs@kth.se>
See /etc/docs/vlan-interfaces.txt.

New log possibilities, framework for coping logs between ramdisk and
USB-storage. See config.flags/ramlog. Also from Pehr.

Possible to control size of ramdisk. See config.data/tmpsize

Many utilities are updated and many are built with uclibc. There are new 
/bin64 and /bin32 directories included in PATH according to kernel arch. 
Scripts are cleaned up.

Kernel 2.6.29-r2 with many patches configured for 64-bit NUNA arch. Tested 
with Opteron and Intel Duo. So far we only support 64-bit kernel.

Kernel has multiqueue support for routing/forwarding. The driver supporting
multiqueue is ixgbe (Intel 10g 82598 chip) niu (SUN neptune 10g and 1g board)
and the igb (Intel 82576 chip) drivers.

Automatic driver module loading via PCI probing. See /etc/eth-detect.conf
(you can of course add needed tags). Modpobe follows eth-detect.conf order.

eth-affinity to setup IRQ affinity among multiqueue capable NIC's. Normally 
run at start.

ifstat2 is improved and have defaults for 10g.

'zile' --  A new emacs like editor.
'edit' now replaced with nano.

Some emerging support for TCAM classifier support in the niu driver via  
ethtool. (Note. A byte order bug for IP/Ports etc)

pktgen can be configured to use multiqueue NIC's.

An optional oprofile package can profile a running system at very little cost.
Very useful for troubleshooting and network and performance understanding.

And bugs of course

Enjoy
