New since 6.0.x series.

Static binaries. All binaries now linked statically against either uclibc or dietlibc. Dynamic libraries removed from system.

More old (hopefully not used anymore) cruft removed.

Support for loading drivers for misc hardware via device-detect.

Configuration now preserved better over upgrades. This is done via default files and setting default values to missing flags.

eth-affinity can now reserve CPUs from being used in the network receive and transmit path.

Daemons now run by default on CPU 0 which is freed from network traffic.

Namespace support added to kernel.

Bifrost can now with the help of 'allcaps'-program "boot" inside a namespace container. This in preparation for virtual router support.

Bifrost optional lxc package exists for doing basic container/namespace things.
