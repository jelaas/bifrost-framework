New since 6.x series.

The Bifrost core distribution is now built completely from a the bifrost-build system.
This means everything in the system is completely tracked. Sources, versions, build instructions and dependencies. https://github.com/jelaas/bifrost-build

A new configure script based on dialog is now included. Makes basic system configuration a bit more fancier.

The included kernels (32 and 64 bit) are based on 2.6.38-rc8 from net-next.
Patches are:
- ixgbe RSS patch (free CPU 0 from bulk traffic)
- igxbe sfp patch (allow any sfp, not just intels)
- DOM support for ixgbe and igb (use ethtool to access)
- pktgen receiver patch (better statistics from pktgen)
- e1000 and e1000e copybreak patch
- backported bugfixes for fib_trie and ipv4/raw.c

Initramfs is used at boot time to find the boot partition by label, run fsck and then mount the boot partition.

ipmi support included (ipmitool).

A new script make_bifrost included to create new bootable bifrost storage devices.

A few utilities for namespace support: ns, nsnetif, veth, macvlan.

iocethtool: for generic ethtool ioctl access.

cpuinfo: script friendly cpu information.

ifinfo: script friendly network interface information.

cpu_pkts: monitor received packet distribution over cpus.

bifrost-upgrade: script to ease upgrading from a previous version of bifrost.
