New since 6.x series.

The Bifrost core distribution is now built completely from the bifrost-build system.
This means everything in the system is completely tracked. Sources, versions, build instructions and dependencies. See "https://github.com/jelaas/bifrost-build".

A new configure script based on dialog is now included. Makes basic system configuration a bit more fancier.

'devtag': Device tagging to keep track of devices. Currently only supports USB-devices. 

The included kernels (32 and 64 bit) are based on 2.6.38-rc8 from net-next.
Patches are:
- ixgbe RSS patch (free CPU 0 from bulk traffic)
- igxbe sfp patch (allow any sfp, not just intels)
- DOM support for ixgbe and igb (use ethtool to access)
- pktgen receiver patch (better statistics from pktgen)
- e1000 and e1000e copybreak patch
- slub_nomerge enabled by default
- niu bugfixes: rx_channel, rx_bytes
- backported bugfixes for fib_trie, ipv4/raw.c, inetpeer, niu and tcp_output.c.

Kernel modules are sorted into a few different packages: supported, unsupported, firmware, vmlinux and wireless.
"Supported" is the core package with kernel and the supported driver modules.
"Firmware" is for all firmware.
"Wireless" is for wireless device drivers.
"Vmlinux" is for the uncompressed kernel and system map.
"Unsupported" is for everything else not in the above categories..

Initramfs is used at boot time to find the boot partition by label, run fsck and then mount the boot partition. The initramfs is a cpio archive included in the kernel image.

ipmi support included (ipmitool).

A new script make_bifrost included to create new bootable bifrost storage devices.

/sbin/backup: the backup script is now configurable ('/etc/config.data/backup.conf').

A few utilities for namespace support: ns, nsnetif, veth, macvlan.

iocethtool: for generic ethtool ioctl access.

cpuinfo: script friendly cpu information.

ifinfo: script friendly network interface information.

cpu_pkts: monitor received packet distribution over cpus.

bifrost-upgrade: script to ease upgrading from a previous version of bifrost.

rfcmd: (for talking to tellsticks I believe).

tty_talk: sends command on serial port and prints response on stdout.

opt-get: very simple package downloader/installer.
