This distribution of the Bifrost Network Project may be used and
distributed according to the terms of the GNU Public License,
incorporated herein by reference. 

Bifrost is collaboration between universities and ISP:s, companies
students and interested hackers.

Topics include network performance, routing, testing, security, 
hardware and software development. As a partial result of is 
specialized Linux distribution.

This distribution consists of free standard Linux software, collected,
modified and optimized at some extent to fit this package.
It's mainly targeted for production and infrastructure networking,
routing/firwalling (on selected hardware), but it is also used in
research and education.
One of the overall design goals is to keep things simple and
straightforward: KISS.

The Bifrost distribution is proven and has been around since 1997.

Bifrost/Linux main features:
    Linux for infrastructure
    Stability
    Network performance
    Simplicity
    Dependency reduction. Bifrost/Linux is completely statically linked.
    Hardware testing and selection.

What is bifrost?
It's a small(ish) straight-forward open-source Linux distribution
aimed at infrastructure networking. It's highly specialized and tuned,
for a selection of chipsets, interface cards and other hardware.
The distribution it also used in various R & D projects. License is GPL.

Who is it intended for?
"Networking people"  with basic skills and interest in Linux/Unix
needing a small flexible network- oriented distribution.

What is it not intended for?
It's not competing with - nor a replacement for - Ubuntu, Red Hat, SUSE etc.
They are doing a great job and have other resources.

What are the objectives?
Hardware selection, software selection, performance tuning and extensive
testing in both lab and in field installations. This is a very
time-consuming process which requires access to HW, lab and competence.
This done  in very a tight loop between developer and demanding production use.
