Some places in the init process will call out to hooks if they are present in this directory.
The hooked must be a textfile that is sourced by bash.

Current hooks:
/etc/config.hooks/inet.netdevs.pre called from etc/rc.d/rc.inet before bringing up the network interfaces.
/etc/config.hooks/inet.netdevs.post called from etc/rc.d/rc.inet after bringing up the network interfaces.
