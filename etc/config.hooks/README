Some places in the init process will call out to hooks if they are present in this directory.
The hooked must be a textfile that is sourced by bash.

Current hooks:
/etc/config.hooks/mount.pre called from etc/rc.S before mounting filesystems
/etc/config.hooks/mount.post called from etc/rc.S after mounting filesystems 
/etc/config.hooks/net.pre called from etc/rc.M before rc.inet
/etc/config.hooks/inet.netdevs.pre called from etc/rc.d/rc.inet before bringing up the network interfaces.
/etc/config.hooks/inet.netdevs.post called from etc/rc.d/rc.inet after bringing up the network interfaces.
/etc/config.hooks/net.post called from etc/rc.M after rc.inet
/etc/config.hooks/opt.pre called from etc/rc.M before opt packages are started
/etc/config.hooks/opt.post called from etc/rc.M after opt packages are started
