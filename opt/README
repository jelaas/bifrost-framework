This is where to put sub packages into the Bifrost system.
For example Emacs:

/opt/emacs

or the Bifrost Nomad web server and Nomad itself:

/opt/www
/opt/nomad

With subdirectories like:

/opt/package/bin
/opt/package/sbin
/opt/package/lib
/opt/package/rc.d

If your adding packages, make sure to add the bin path to
/etc/profile:

  # Adding possible paths for opt-packages
  PATH=$PATH:/opt/emacs/bin:/opt/nomad/bin:/opt/sniff/bin:
  /opt/snmp/bin:/opt/snmp/sbin:/opt/www/apache/bin:/opt/zebra/bin

and add it to /etc/rc.d/rc.M and perhaps create a yes/no-flag for
it under /etc/config.flags, such as:

  # Start the Argus logger
  export CONFIG_ARGUS=`cat /etc/config.flags/argus`
  if [ $CONFIG_ARGUS = "yes" ]; then
      if [ -f /opt/sniff/rc.d/rc.argus ]; then
	  PATH=$PATH:/opt/sniff/bin
	  /opt/sniff/rc.d/rc.argus
      fi
  fi

If your using extra shared libraries under an /opt/package/lib
directory, add the directory to the /etc/ld.so.conf file and
make sure to run ldconfig with the disk i writeable mode.
Ldconfig runs at every boot, but to start using the new package
without a reboot, ldconfig will be a necessary step.

Temporary files and pid/lock files, will still have to go in the
/var/run or /tmp directory, unless you're using a separate writeable
disk for logging etc.
